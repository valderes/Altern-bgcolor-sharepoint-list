# Altern-bgcolor-shareponit-list

** Change the background color of the titles in a Shaprepont grouped list view according content string.**

To change the backgrond color of the Grouped List Title baed on a string in the title (this was what I need), like all customisation on Sjarepoit, we use only JSON commands.

In this case, if the title contains "Curitiba" the background color must be green, if the title contains "Porto Alegre" the background color must be... "prurple"(?).
If you need other words, jus use it in the criteras

We also insert the sum of item of eacht title.
